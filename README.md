# Employee Management System

## Project Overview

This is a CRUD-based Employee Management System built with Flask, SQLite for development, and Docker for containerization and deployment. The application allows the management of employees, departments, positions, and statuses through a RESTful API. User authentication is implemented using Flask-Login.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Employees: Create, Read, Update, Delete employees.
  - Positions: Create, Read, Update, Delete positions.
  - Departments: Create, Read, Update, Delete departments.
  - Statuses: Create, Read, Update, Delete statuses.
  - User: Create (In case drop all table)
  
- **User Authentication**: 
  - Implemented using Flask-Login.
  
- **API Endpoints**:
  - Provides a RESTful API for interacting with employees, departments, positions, and statuses.
  
- **Input Validation**: 
  - Includes validation for employee names, addresses, salary, and image URLs.
  
- **Dockerized Application**:
  - The application is contained Dockerfile for support Docker setup

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Backend framework
- **Flask-Login**: User authentication
- **SQLite**: Database for development
- **Docker**: Provide multiple setup method
- **Unit Testing**: `unittest` for automated testing
- **Postman**: for automated integration testing

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Docker (Optional)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaisupt/flask-employee-management.git
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
3. **Install the Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Set Up Environment Variables: Create a `.env` file with the following content**:
    ```bash
    FLASK_ENV=development
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///employee_management.db
5. **Run the Application**:
  ```bash
  flask  run
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  flask -â€”debug run
  ```
  for turn on debug mode
  - The application will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

6. **Switch Environment(Optional)**:
For change to production mode
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=production
```
For change to development mode
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

### Docker Setup

1. **Build Docker Image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t flask-employee-management-app .
2. **Check Docker Image**:
    ```bash
    docker images
  - In `REPOSITORY` column should have `flask-employee-management-app`
3. **Run Docker Image**:
    ```bash
    docker run -P flask-employee-management-app
    ```
    * Default docker run will be production mode
4. **Check port of the running container**:
    ```bash
    docker ps
  - The application will run on the front port that show in `PORTS` column before `->5000/tcp`

#### Example API Request (Using cURL)

To create a new position
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/position \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "name": "Backend Developer",
        "salary": 10000
    }'
  ```

#### Run Unit Test

Unit tests are written using unittest. You can run them with the following command:
  ```bash
  python -m unittest discover tests
  ```

#### Run Integration via Postman

This github repository also included Postman Automated Integration Test file in `postman` directory

To perform Automated Integration Test via Postman(https://www.postman.com/) please follow the step below:

1. Open Postman 
2. Import Postman collection and Postman environment file from postman directory
3. Go to collection "emp_mgm" make sure it use "emp_mgm" environment
4. Click Run
5. Uncheck all the box and Set delay to 10ms
6. Click "Run emp_mgm" button


#### Known Issues
- The application is currently configured to use SQLite for local development. Ensure that the database is switched to PostgreSQL/MySQL for production environments.

#### Future Improvements
- Implement soft deletion of employees instead of hard deletion.
- Add frontend components to interact with the API.
- Improve role-based access control for user permissions.
